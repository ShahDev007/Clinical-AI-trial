Mr. John Doe, a 45-year-old male, was admitted to San Diego General Hospital on November 12, 2024, after experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath. His past medical history includes hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Upon arrival, an electrocardiogram confirmed the presence of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 

Dr. Emily Carter, a cardiologist, performed an emergency coronary angioplasty to relieve the blockage in the left anterior descending artery. The procedure was successful, with no immediate complications reported. During his hospital stay, the patient was started on a regimen of Aspirin 81mg daily, Metformin 500mg twice daily, and Atorvastatin 20mg nightly to manage his condition and reduce future cardiovascular risks.

John was discharged on November 15, 2024, with instructions to follow a cardiac rehabilitation program and adhere to a heart-healthy diet. He was advised to monitor his blood pressure and glucose levels regularly and to follow up with Dr. Carter in two weeks. The discharge summary emphasized the importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications to prevent further cardiac events.
